Then, we both happened to choose UT-Austin for the next chapter in our lives.  Whereas I dropped out after a semeseter, you kept going and finished.  This post, though, is actually about something you taught me in high school without even trying.<br /><br /><div style="clear:both;"></div><br /><br />You were the first person I'd met in my 16 years of life who was undeniably better than me at everything.  Just to name some examples:<br /><br /><ul><li>You were in calculus three -- whereas I was struggling through calculus one. </li>
<li>You were in the choir -- whereas I could barely carry a tune at the time. </li>
<li>You were socially gifted, poised, and mindful -- whereas I was often awkward or oblivious. </li>
<li>You were a better writer than I -- in spite of the fact that I prided myself in being good at writing.</li>
<li>You had better grades than me across every subject, while simultaneously being involved in more extra-curriculars. </li></ul><br />(No surprise that two years later, you breezed through college, whereas I dropped out.)<br /><br />Boys at that age get exposed to a lot of weird ideas like: &quot;boys are better at math&quot;, or &quot;boys are better leaders&quot;, or &quot;boys think more logically&quot;.  And other bullshit.<br /><br />I feel lucky that you were there to preemptively innoculate me against all of this and more.  No lie: I considered you the smartest person I'd ever met -- an opinion I secretly held for years, even after we lost touch.  I'm sad that I never told you.<br /><br />Gender issues have always been important to me -- as someone who grew up in a country were women (i.e. my mom) didn't have basic rights (like driving).  I've probably been thinking about gender equality since I was five or six.  Not to mention, I have two younger sisters, both of whom have been feminists of some form or another since we were children.<br /><br />Still, it's clear to me now with almost two decades of hindsight, I was lucky to meet a girl I looked up to so much -- at preciesely the age when I was starting to form inflated opinions about my own intelligence.  To this day, every dumb stereotype I get exposed to pops like a bubble against memories of you.  The net effect of this over the years has, I believe, had deep personal value to me.<br /><br />I work in a field that is dominated by men -- and I suspect I will for the rest of my life.  There's a lot of toxic masculinity in the software world -- and some of it even comes out of the mouths of people I would otherwise respect.  The older I get, the more thankful I am that I don't hold those beliefs; and the more sad I get that the men who do hold them never received the opportunity to be humbled by you in high school.<br /><br />Thanks for being you.</div></div><footer style="text-align:center;"><hr /><p><em>Stephen R.
