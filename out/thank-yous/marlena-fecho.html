You were better than me at literally all of the musical skills that I wanted to be good at:

<ul><li>Singing</li>
<li>Playing guitar</li>
<li>Writing songs</li></ul></div><br /><br />(div style: (properties clear: &quot;both&quot;))<br /><br />I'm very grateful that you played guitar and sang with me so often in spite of my relative musical clumsiness.<br /><br />The strange thing was: Every time we sang together, I could feel myself improving.  It was like gaining XP for free.   After each of our sessions, I could go home and finger pick with fewer errors, sing more confidently, and even write songs more creatively.  It's almost as if music is a kind of language -- in that it can be learned simply through &quot;conversation&quot;, through immersion.<br /><br />But that's not why I'm writing this post.  There's one particular thing you said to me that stuck with me, and it's a fundamental part of my creative process today -- in music and beyond.<br /><br />You said that when you write songs, you write them in what you called &quot;fragments&quot;.  For example, you might write a verse here, or a tune there -- small bits of creativity that aren't yet part of a larger whole.  You said that sometimes the fragments come together like magic into something more.<br /><br />Verses that were unrelated when you wrote them might, suddenly, strike you as perfect together -- and <b>BAM</b>, there's a song.  Or a tune that sounds nice might suddenly strike you as applicable to some verse you have floating around -- and <b>BAM</b>, there's a song.<br /><br />It was this idea of (what I shall call) <b>non-linear writing</b> that I've adopted into my life and still use today.  It seems so obvious now.  But at the time, my creative process was very linear:<br /><br /><ul><li>Make time to write song S</li>
<li>Sit down and write first line of S</li>
<li>Write the second line of S</li>
<li>... and so on until S is complete</li></ul><br /><br />It worked, but it could also be frustrating and slow.<br /><br />I still write that way on occasion -- but the ability to be non-linear about my creative output was a sea-change for me.  It all came from one simple piece of advice you gave me:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b>Write down all your fragments, no matter what.</b></div><br /><br />To this day, I do.  And some of my best ideas in song-writing, fiction, software engineering, business, and product design have come from that practice.  I hope you're still doing it too.  And I hope working at Pixar still leaves you time for making your own art.<br /></div></div><footer style="text-align:center;"><hr /><p><em>Stephen R.
