But instead of going to classes, I played chess with you.  Within a semester, with failing grades, I had dropped out.<br /><br />It turned out to be the best decision of my life.  So, thank you!<br /><br />For one thing, I learned a lot about chess -- but more importantly I learned about <b>learning</b> chess.  Your structured way of studying the game was one of my early glimpses into the idea that some people's learning algorithms are better than others.  In my efforts to get better at chess (in a futile attempt to beat you), I found myself staying up late to review the last few hundred years worth of research into how people learn.<br /><br />This fascination with learning followed me all the way through my undergraduate degree when I went to Southwestern University two years later.  It followed me into my Ph.D. and beyond.  I've now been study how people learn to code for almost a decade.<br /><br />Even in my personal life, when I learn things (e.g. music, American Sign Language, etc.), I take the design of my learning processes seriously. This simple shift of world-view has, in no uncertain terms, changed my life:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b>Don't just learn things; learn how to learn things.</b></div><br /><br />If we ever meet again, let's play some chess -- for old time's sake.  Maybe I'll finally win.</div></div><footer style="text-align:center;"><hr /><p><em>Stephen R.
