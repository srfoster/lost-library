You were better than me at literally <b>all</b> of the musical skills that I wanted to be good at:<br /><br /><ul><li>Singing</li>
<li>Playing guitar</li>
<li>Writing songs</li></ul><br /><br />I'm very grateful that you played guitar and sang with me so often in spite of my relative musical clumsiness.  (I'm not saying I was terrible -- just that compared to you, I was quite the amateur.)<br /><br />The strange thing was: Every time we sang together, I felt like I got better.  It was like gaining XP for free.   After one of our sessions, I could go home and finger pick with fewer errors, sing more confidently, and even write songs more creatively.  It's almost as if music is a kind of language -- in that it can be learned simply through &quot;conversation&quot;, through immersion.<br /><br />But that's not why I'm writing this post.  There's one particular thing you said to me that stuck with me, and I still use it.</div></div><footer style="text-align:center;"><hr /><p><em>Stephen R.
