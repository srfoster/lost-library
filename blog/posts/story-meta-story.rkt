Consider learning that an ancient tome you found in a used bookstore was written as its author slowly went insane.  
Knowing this would change the experience of reading that book!  I, for one, would like to know such @bold{meta-stories} up front.  Some might prefer to learn it afterward.  But I think we can all agree that knowing the @bold{meta-stories} at @emph{some} point generally enhances the reading experience.


@(div style: (properties clear: "both"))

Examples of how important @bold{meta-stories} are need not be as dramatic as a writer going insane.  Something as simple as knowing if a story is true or false is a huge part of the reading experience.  A false story whose @bold{meta-story} claims it to be true is a lie -- which bothers most people.  As it should.

For me, the most important @bold{meta-story} is:  

@centered{
  @bold{Why?}
}

I've never seen a case where it detracted from the reading experience to know @emph{why} the author is writing to you.
For example, I feel quite cheated when I think I'm reading an informational piece, only to find that it's actually trying to sell me something.

Don't worry; I won't do that to you.    


I'll be honest, if I had to pick a single "Why?" -- one "Why?" to rule them all -- it would be:

@centered{
  @bold{I don't know if I'll be around forever.}
}

My father's father died in his 60s -- after a year-long battle against cancer.  He outlived his own mother by only a year.  My father died of the same kind of cancer in his 50s.  No need to plot trend lines on a graph.  My 40s aren't far away.

Grappling with my own mortality led me, long ago, to seek refuge in mindfulness meditation, philosophy, and writing.  The inconvenience of having an unknown, unknowable deadline has always prompted me to get serious about living.

The irony is: Part of living is figuring out how to live.  For me, that means getting serious about writing.  If I can learn about myself through writing, great.  If I can learn something that helps others, even better.  I owe the world a lot; and I want to pay that debt forward. 

That's my @bold{meta-story}.
