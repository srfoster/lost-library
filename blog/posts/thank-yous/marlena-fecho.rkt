  Marlena, we met in graduate school at UCSD, probably around 2012.  You were better than me at literally all of the musical skills that I wanted to be good at:

  @ul{
    @li{Singing}
    @li{Playing guitar}
    @li{Writing songs}
  }
  }

  (div style: (properties clear: "both"))

  I'm very grateful that you played guitar and sang with me so often in spite of my relative musical clumsiness.  

  The strange thing was: Every time we sang together, I could feel myself improving.  It was like gaining XP for free.   After each of our sessions, I could go home and finger pick with fewer errors, sing more confidently, and even write songs more creatively.  It's almost as if music is a kind of language -- in that it can be learned simply through "conversation", through immersion.   

  But that's not why I'm writing this post.  There's one particular thing you said to me that stuck with me, and it's a fundamental part of my creative process today -- in music and beyond.
  
  You said that when you write songs, you write them in what you called "fragments".  For example, you might write a verse here, or a tune there -- small bits of creativity that aren't yet part of a larger whole.  You said that sometimes the fragments come together like magic into something more.

  Verses that were unrelated when you wrote them might, suddenly, strike you as perfect together -- and @bold{BAM}, there's a song.  Or a tune that sounds nice might suddenly strike you as applicable to some verse you have floating around -- and @bold{BAM}, there's a song. 

  It was this idea of (what I shall call) @bold{non-linear writing} that I've adopted into my life and still use today.  It seems so obvious now.  But at the time, my creative process was very linear:

  @ul{
    @li{Make time to write song S}
    @li{Sit down and write first line of S}
    @li{Write the second line of S}
    @li{... and so on until S is complete}
  }  

  It worked, but it could also be frustrating and slow.

  I still write that way on occasion -- but the ability to be non-linear about my creative output was a sea-change for me.  It all came from one simple piece of advice you gave me: 

  @centered{
    @bold{Write down all your fragments, no matter what.}
  }
 
  To this day, I do.  And some of my best ideas in song-writing, fiction, software engineering, business, and product design have come from that practice.  I hope you're still doing it too.  And I hope working at Pixar still leaves you time for making your own art.
