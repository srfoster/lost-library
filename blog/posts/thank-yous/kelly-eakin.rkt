  We went to the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts together and graduated from that red-bricked school in 2003.  Then, we both happened to choose UT-Austin for the next chapter in our lives.  Whereas I dropped out after a semeseter, you kept going and finished.  This post, though, is actually about something you taught me in high school without even trying.

  @(div style: (properties clear: "both"))

  You were the first person I'd met in my 16 years of life who was undeniably better than me at everything.  Just to name some examples:

  @ul{
    @li{You were in calculus three -- whereas I was struggling through calculus one. }
    @li{You were in the choir -- whereas I could barely carry a tune at the time. }
    @li{You were socially gifted, poised, and mindful -- whereas I was often awkward or oblivious. }
    @li{You were a better writer than I -- in spite of the fact that I prided myself in being good at writing.}
    @li{You had better grades than me across every subject, while simultaneously being involved in more extra-curriculars. }
  }
  (No surprise that two years later, you breezed through college, whereas I dropped out.)

  Boys at that age get exposed to a lot of weird ideas like: "boys are better at math", or "boys are better leaders", or "boys think more logically".  And other bullshit.

  I feel lucky that you were there to preemptively innoculate me against all of this and more.  No lie: I considered you the smartest person I'd ever met -- an opinion I secretly held for years, even after we lost touch.  I'm sad that I never told you. 

  Gender issues have always been important to me -- as someone who grew up in a country were women (i.e. my mom) didn't have basic rights (like driving).  I've probably been thinking about gender equality since I was five or six.  Not to mention, I have two younger sisters, both of whom have been feminists of some form or another since we were children.

  Still, it's clear to me now with almost two decades of hindsight, I was lucky to meet a girl I looked up to so much -- at preciesely the age when I was starting to form inflated opinions about my own intelligence.  To this day, every dumb stereotype I get exposed to pops like a bubble against memories of you.  The net effect of this over the years has, I believe, had deep personal value to me.  

  I work in a field that is dominated by men -- and I suspect I will for the rest of my life.  There's a lot of toxic masculinity in the software world -- and some of it even comes out of the mouths of people I would otherwise respect.  The older I get, the more thankful I am that I don't hold those beliefs; and the more sad I get that the men who do hold them never received the opportunity to be humbled by you in high school.
 
  Thanks for being you.
