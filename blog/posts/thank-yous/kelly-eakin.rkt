  We went to the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts together and graduated from that red-bricked school in 2003.  Then, we both happened to choose UT-Austin for the next chapter in our lives.  Whereas I dropped out after a semeseter, you kept going and finished.  This post, though, is actually about something you taught me in high school.
