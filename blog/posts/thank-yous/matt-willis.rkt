  In 2003, I enrolled at UT Austin -- which has arguably the best computer science program in the world.  But instead of going to classes, I played chess with you.  Within a semester, with failing grades, I had dropped out.  

  It turned out to be the best decision of my life.  So, thank you!

  For one thing, I learned a lot about chess -- but more importantly I learned about @bold{learning} chess.  Your structured way of studied the game was one of my early glimpses into the idea that some learning "algorithms" are superior to others.  In my efforts to get better at chess (in a futile attempt to beat you), I found myself staying up late to review the last few hundred years worth of research into how people learn. 

  This fascination with learning followed me all the way through my undergraduate degree when I went back two years later.  It followed me into my Ph.D. and beyond.  I've been study how people learn to code for almost a decade now.  

  Even in my personal life, when I learn things (e.g. music, American Sign Language, etc.), I take the design of my learning processes seriously. This simple shift of world-view has, in no uncertain terms, changed my life:

    @bold{Don't just learn things; learn how to learn things.}

  If we ever meet again, let's play some chess -- for old time's sake.  Maybe I'll finally win.
